# Kettle - Steam API Client Library for .NET

This was supposed to be a simple library for accessing the Steam API an
it does that for a few endpoints I need. However, this is so much code for doing
so little it's crazy. Almost copied from octokit.net which was a mistake because
that's a large project and it works for them. Something like this can be much
smaller and should be easier read. This has so much code I don't think I ever want
to work on it ever again. I did learn though.
